# KDK Minimal (v1.0.0)

A minimal starter theme for WordPress, inspired by Joomla's templating model.

Instead of choking your theme folder with dozens of PHP and CSS files, everything is routed from the main theme file (index.php) and organized in subfolders, per entity type (e.g. post, category and so on).

This is work in progress, so please use with caution.


## To Do
- Secure includes
- Enrich each sub-template with all available default fields
- Add more widget positions
- Integrate with Customizer
